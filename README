OVERVIEW

This is an authentication module for Movable Type derived from the included
BasicAuth.pm module.  It is intended for organizations using CoSign and LDAP
who wish to extend their single sign-on capabilities to the free edition of
Movable Type.

At the time of this writing, this module is deemed in a "workable" state; it is
probably not perfect.  It is not a plug-and-play solution, but will hopefully
save somebody somewhere some sweat and tears.

USAGE

- Edit the LDAP-related code in CoSign.pm to suit your LDAP server and schema.
- Place CoSign.pm in lib/MT/Auth
- Add the following to mt-config.cgi:

  AuthenticationModule CoSign
  ExternalUserManagement 1
